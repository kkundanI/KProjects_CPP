# KProjects_CPP : 
  ðŸ‘‹ Hi,ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to have you here!
  
  Welcome to my **KProjects_CPP** repository ! It Includes the projects that i've done while and after learning C++ . The projects are just a curious trial that came into my mind and planned to give them a try. I have done many unsual codes but had entitled only Four of them as Project since these can be used in the real world and cuz i enjoyed them most . The four Projects are : 

* **CALCULATOR :**
  > The Calculator project is a comprehensive and engaging program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a single calculation. It supports both integer and floating-point operands, enables users to include spaces in their expressions and it saves and shows all the previous Calculations too . Well there's still alot space for improvements( * Use result in next calculation , * enable parenthesis , * Better User Interface) that i would love you to help me with .
