# KProjects_CPP : 
  ðŸ‘‹ Hi,ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to have you here!
  
  Welcome to my **KProjects_CPP** repository ! It Includes the projects that i've done while and after learning C++ . The projects are just a curious trial that came into my mind and planned to give them a try. I have done many unsual codes but had entitled only Four of them as Project since these can be used in the real world and cuz i enjoyed them most . The four Projects are : 

* **CALCULATOR :**
  > The Calculator project is a comprehensive and engaging program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a single calculation. It supports both integer and floating-point operands, enables users to include spaces in their expressions and it saves and shows all the previous Calculations too . Well there's still alot space for improvements( * Use result in next calculation , * enable parenthesis , * Better User Interface) that i would love you to help me with .


# Calculator Project

## Description

This project is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes input from the user in the form of an expression, such as `1+2-3*4%5`, and outputs the result of the calculation.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two subdirectories:

* `Basics`: This directory contains the unusual concepts or programs used in the calculator's main program.
* `Main`: This directory contains the main code of the calculator and its variations or versions. Currently, there are four versions of the calculator.

## Usage

To run the calculator, simply compile and execute the main program. The program will prompt the user to enter an expression. Once the user has entered an expression, press enter and the calculator will output the result of the calculation.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the calculator:

* `1+2-3*4%5 = 0.6`
* `2*3-4/5 = 3.4`
* `10^2 = 100`
* `sqrt(16) = 4`
